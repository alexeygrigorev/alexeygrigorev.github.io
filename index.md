### IT4BI related questions

I am very happy to answer any questions about the [IT4BI program](http://it4bi.univ-tours.fr/), but please do the following before contacting me:

- Check [the official page](http://it4bi.univ-tours.fr), especially the ["Master Programme"](http://it4bi.univ-tours.fr/home/master-programme/) and ["Students"](http://it4bi.univ-tours.fr/home/students/) pages.
- I wrote a couple of blog posts on [itshared.org](itshared.org) about the program that you may find useful: [IT4BI: How to](http://www.itshared.org/2015/01/it4bi-how-to.html) and [IT4BI FAQ](http://www.itshared.org/2015/01/it4bi-faq.html). Please do read the FAQ, it's very likely that your questions is already there. 
- If you don't find your question there, I will be very happy to try to answer it. The preferrable way of asking is by using the [IT4BI tag](https://www.quora.com/IT4BI) on [Quora](http://quora.com). This way a) other IT4BI students can also see your questions and help if I can't and b) other applicants will benefit from the answer. 
- Finally, if for some reason you want to contact me directly, using email is the best way. Please keep in mind that I may publish the question and the answer on the FAQ.
